## Summary

The Behavioural Modification System- Master Settlement Agreement (BMS-MSA) is a cooperative legal and strategic framework designed to address the widespread impact of behaviour-shaping digital technologies.

The BMS-MSA aims to support regulators, law schools, public-interest institutions, and responsible commercial actors in coordinating a fair and constructive response to emerging global challenges.

It maps the full ecosystem — from platforms and developers to advertisers, payment systems, and infrastructure providers — and offers a pathway toward pre-emptive resolution, risk management, and shared standards.

    Non-profit organisations may adapt and apply it freely for non-commercial purposes.

    Commercial users, such as legal funders or firms using it as part of litigation or consulting, are asked to request a licence to ensure transparency and alignment.

The BMS-MSA is intended to aid prevention of harm, adaptation, and shared accountability across the digital economy.

## 1. Purpose

This Agreement provides a standardised framework for resolving or preventing harms linked to behavioural modification systems (BMS). It is designed to support jurisdictional adaptation, public-interest litigation, ethical reform, and strategic settlements across sectors and borders.

## 2. Scope

This Agreement applies to harms arising from the use or design of systems intended to modify, steer, or exploit user behaviour at scale. Relevant harms include, but are not limited to:

    Digital addiction and compulsive use

    Youth mental health degradation

    Self-harm and suicide ideation

    Algorithmic discrimination and radicalisation

    Exploitative monetisation (e.g. loot boxes, dark patterns)

    Involuntary surveillance and behavioural targeting

    Incitement to violence, genocide, or social unrest

## 3. Acknowledgement of Harm

Parties using or citing this Agreement acknowledge the occurrence of significant, avoidable harms connected to behavioural modification systems. Such use does not constitute an admission of legal liability.

## 4. Licensing Terms

This framework is published under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence.  Non-profit and academic use is encouraged and unrestricted, provided proper attribution is given and adaptations are shared alike. Use in any commercial context — including litigation funding, legal services, compliance solutions, or monetised consulting — requires a negotiated licence.

To initiate a licensing discussion, please email bms-msa@proton.me with the following:

    Name and organisation

    Description of intended use

    Jurisdiction(s) and sector(s) involved

    Commercial or non-commercial classification

    Whether adaptation or localisation is anticipated

    Any relevant timelines or milestones

Licensing typically follows a royalty-based model linked to outcomes or revenues, with no arbitrary caps, but flexible structuring to support fair and proportionate use. Where appropriate, a modest one-time fee or minimum guarantee may also be included.  We aim to respond within 14 working days.

For commercial licensing enquiries, a non-refundable deposit may be requested before negotiations begin. This helps cover legal and administrative costs and is credited against any final agreement. Not applicable to non-profit or academic use, which is already licensed.

## 5. Pro Bono Use Clause

In urgent or time-sensitive legal situations — such as injunctions, early-stage negotiations, or public-interest litigation — qualified legal professionals may invoke and adapt this Agreement without prior licensing, provided the following conditions are met:

A brief notification is submitted to bms-msa@proton.me within 14 days of first use, outlining:

    The nature of the case,

    Jurisdiction(s),

    Intended scope of use.

If commercial value or financial settlement results from such use, the user agrees to enter into a good-faith post-facto licensing discussion.

This provision is designed to support justice and enable access without waiving the author’s licensing rights, especially in commercial contexts. It does not apply to for-profit entities using the Agreement for strategic, client-facing, or repeat commercial activities without notification or licensing.

## 6. Chain Referral Clause

Institutional users of the BMSMSA are encouraged to refer three or more peer organisations to increase adoption and accountability. Where safe, these referrals may be logged (without personal data) to visualise ethical spread and jurisdictional uptake.

## 7. Platform Participation

Digital platform operators may align with this Agreement through:

    Transparent disclosure of algorithmic systems

    External auditing or impact review

    Participation in structured settlement processes

    Co-development of safeguards, especially for minors and vulnerable users

Participation is voluntary. Absence of platform adoption does not restrict litigation or policy adoption by other actors.

## 8. Value Chain of Harm and Engagement Priority

Responsibility for BMS-related harms is distributed across a complex, multi-actor supply chain. While no single party is solely accountable, some are better positioned to enable reform, resolve legacy harm, or adopt protective practices.

Those constituents of the behavioural modification supply chain most likely to benefit from early settlement, licensing, or ethical alignment include:

    Professional service providers
    (e.g. consultants, public relations firms, ethics auditors, multi-sector advisers)

    Advertising and ad tech actors
    (targeting platforms, campaign intermediaries, brand-facing optimisers)

    Application developers
    (particularly those monetising via youth, gambling, microtransactions, or nudge design)

    Legal and compliance advisers
    (with visibility into risk, governance, or platform regulation)

    Payment intermediaries
    (enabling behavioural monetisation through app stores, wallets, or spending triggers)

    Academic institutions and legal clinics
    (engaged in public interest litigation, ethics research, or legal education)

    Platform operators
    (hosting, amplifying, or monetising user behaviour through algorithmic engagement)

    Algorithm designers and AI vendors
    (providing the underlying systems for sorting, ranking, and modifying user behaviour)

    Data brokers
    (entities aggregating, refining, or trading behavioural and psychographic data)

    Cloud infrastructure and hosting providers
    (data centres, scalable compute, content delivery networks)

    Telecommunications providers and ISPs
    (broadband, mobile, and connectivity actors involved in the distribution of BMS-enabled content)

    Lobbyists and trade associations
    (especially where strategic delay or policy shaping has limited reform)

    Regulators and statutory bodies
    (where oversight failure or underenforcement may have enabled systemic harm)

Engagement from these sectors may include:

    Quiet citation or internal adoption

    Voluntary licensing requests

    Contribution to audits or reform templates

    Public participation in early adopter networks or policy design

## 9. Whistleblower Mechanism

The BMSMSA does not store or receive evidence directly.
Individuals with credible disclosures are encouraged to report via secure, independent channels.
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) is recommended for encrypted submission:

Whistleblowers are advised to seek legal counsel before disclosure.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

##  What is the BMS-MSA?

The BMS-MSA (Behavioural Manipulation Supply Chain – Master Settlement Agreement) is a public, open framework designed to support legal and strategic action against entities profiting from manipulative digital technologies. It defines the full behavioural manipulation supply chain and proposes structured, replicable approaches for litigation, negotiation, compliance, and reform.

## Who created the BMS-MSA?

The BMS-MSA was authored by an independent researcher and strategist committed to accelerating ethical accountability in digital systems. It is published under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence and can be freely adapted for non-commercial use.

## Who can use the BMS-MSA?

Non-profits, law schools, and public interest litigators may use and adapt the framework freely under the terms of the licence.

Commercial actors, including litigation funders, law firms, and compliance providers, must request a commercial licence to use or adapt it.

## Is this legal advice?

No. The BMS-MSA is a strategic and legal framework — not individual legal advice. Users are expected to consult qualified legal professionals when applying or adapting the agreement.

## Can I modify or adapt the BMS-MSA for my jurisdiction or use case?

Yes. Adaptation is encouraged — especially by legal clinics, academics, and public-interest groups — as long as it remains non-commercial and you attribute the source and share adaptations under the same licence (BY-NC-SA 4.0).

## What counts as "commercial use"?

Commercial use includes (but is not limited to):

    Using the framework to support fee-based litigation or settlements.

    Embedding it in compliance, due diligence, or ESG consultancy services.

    Incorporating it into commercial legal technologies or platforms.
    If in doubt, email bms-msa@proton.me for clarification or to request a licence.

## How do I request a commercial licence?

To request a licence, email:

    Name and organisation

    Jurisdiction(s) of interest

    Description of intended use

    Whether adaptation is planned

    Timeline or urgency

A templated clause is included in this document to support this process.

## Are royalties or fees involved in commercial licensing?

Licensing may involve a one-time fee, royalty, or bespoke terms depending on scale, exclusivity, and proposed use. The goal is to fund continued development and ensure fair contribution by commercial actors while remaining accessible to public-interest users.

## What if a solicitor uses the BMS-MSA urgently before licensing?

A provision allows for expedited, post-facto licensing in time-sensitive cases. Solicitors or public-interest litigators can invoke the framework without upfront delay, provided they notify within 14 days and agree to fair post-facto discussion if commercial benefit results.

## Can regulators, parliamentary bodies, or courts reference it?

Yes. The BMS-MSA is published to accelerate accountability and reform. You are encouraged to cite, reference, or adapt the framework in official proceedings, reports, or investigations, especially where public interest is at stake.

## Can this be used in class actions or multi-jurisdictional litigation?

Absolutely. The BMS-MSA is designed for scalable adaptation. It can serve as a unifying or harmonising template for mass claims across borders or as a model for structured settlement negotiation.

## What’s the benefit for early adopters?

Early adopters help shape international momentum and may:

    Earn reputational benefits (through certification or badges),

    Be invited to collaborate on future versions,

    Influence regulatory and strategic discourse.

## How do I stay updated?

Future versions, translated summaries, and usage examples will be shared at the project’s GitHub site. Email bms-msa@proton.me to request notification or to suggest improvements.
